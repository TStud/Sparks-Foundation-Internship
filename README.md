# Sparks Foundation Data Science Internship

## Description
Some of the basic Internship Tasks which were assigned by The Sparks Foundation during their virtual Data Science Internship program. The tasks are of beginner level and pretty easy to perform where you will get knowledge about classification and regression algorithms, Supervised and unsupervised learning including data analysis.

## Task 1 - To Explore Supervised Learning Algorithm (Linear Regression)
This task contains basic problem statement where you have to predict the score of the student in exams where you got independent feature as the hours of study that particular student does in entire day. Using Linear Regression you have to predict and visualize the score student will acheive after studying for given amount of time.

## Task 2 - To Explore Unsupervised Learning Algorithm (K-Nearest-Neighbour Clustering)
Here you need to explore unsupervised learning algorithm aka clustering algorithm where I used the KNN algorithm for predicting the optimum number of clusters using 'Iris' dataset.

## Special Thanks
A huge thanks for The Sparks Foundation's GRIP Data Science Internship for giving this opportunity for showcasing my skills and to work on such amazing use cases.
